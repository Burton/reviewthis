This is a simple list of Gmail search terms that will find all of those annoying emails you get from the online merchants you use, asking you for feedback on your experience. 

## "Installation"
Add a Gmail filter. Use the file's contents as your query. Then do whatever action you like--trash it, autorespond with your own annoying message, etc.
